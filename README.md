Demo apps / widgets based on angular elements (custom elements)

# Angular Elements
Angular Elements is an intiative by the Angular Team and has a label of a new idea Angular Labs. 
You can learn about that in [Rob Wormald](https://github.com/robwormald)'s amazing [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljsOPm4MMEo) at Angular Mix.

## Repo's purpose

The idea is to share demo apps / widgets using angular-elements that are reusable as Custom Elements throughout
web pages built on any framework (or no framework at all).

You can build amazing web components using angular-elements and share them here so anyone can use them.
